# Things to do, or consider:
## Classes/Abstract representation
- Consider more, smaller classes for representing things like Symbols (assets)
- Consider connection classes for connecting other classes together
- Events? 
- Handlers?
- AsyncIO integration
    - runs the core loop, fetching data and processing logic.
- Blinker integration
    - lets modules talk to each other without being tightly coupled.
